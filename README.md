# Todo App

Todo App is a simple web application where a user can save daily tasks to avoid missing any activity. A user can add new task, delete task, mark task as completed or uncompleted. This app makes a HTTP request to an API where the todo data is stored. This App was built using React and is part of a react crash course.
